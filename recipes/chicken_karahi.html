    <h3>Chicken Karahi</h3>
    <p>Chicken karahi is a popular South Asian dish known for its bold, aromatic flavors and rich tomato-based gravy. Traditionally cooked in a wok-like pan called a karahi, the dish combines chicken with fresh tomatoes, garlic, ginger, green chilies, and a blend of spices that create a slightly tangy and spicy taste.</p>
    <p>What makes chicken karahi special is its simplicity and freshness—there’s no heavy marinade or long cooking process. It’s often finished with julienned ginger, green chilies, and fresh cilantro, and served hot with naan or roti, making it a favorite at both home meals and restaurant tables.</p>
